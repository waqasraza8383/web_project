# Git Lab Reflection

During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control and how to manage files in a repository. I practiced creating, adding, committing, and deleting files, which helped me understand how Git tracks changes over time.

I also learned how to work with branches by creating a new branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch. This showed me how multiple versions of a project can be developed safely without affecting the main code.

Overall, this lab improved my understanding of Git workflows and gave me confidence in using GitHub to manage and share projects.
